Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the turn total). At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions:</br>

 - **New game:** To start the game over.
   
<br>Players take turns swapping rolls after each round, and keeping track of how much they've banked, aiming to be the first person to reach your chosen target number.
